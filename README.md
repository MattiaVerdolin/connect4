# 🎮 Connect4

## 📝 Overview
This project is a software version of the classic **Connect4** game, developed for the **Software Engineering 1** course.  
The application follows an **MVC architecture for the frontend** and a **multilayer approach for the backend**, ensuring a clear separation between game logic and user interface.

The project was developed as a team effort and represents our **first structured approach to software engineering**. While the graphical interface is quite simple, the focus was on **applying best practices in software architecture** rather than creating an advanced UI.
